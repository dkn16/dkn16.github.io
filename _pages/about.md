Hello! My name is Kangning Diao (刁康宁), and I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. in the esteemed group of [Prof. Yi Mao](http://i.astro.tsinghua.edu.cn/~ymao/) at Tsinghua University. My research focuses on the 21 cm signal, with a particular emphasis on employing statistical methods. I am especially intrigued by high-dimensional inference techniques, gradient-based models, and ML-based generative models. In terms of programming, I am proficient in Python and frequently utilize packages such as `JAX` and `PyTorch`.

Outside of my academic pursuits, I have cultivated several hobbies. As a Tsinghua student, I prioritize physical fitness and actively participate in Taekwondo as a member of the university team. I dedicate an amount of time each week to exercising and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Additionally, I have a keen interest in playing the guitar, although I still consider myself a novice. Lastly, I thoroughly enjoy cooking, particularly Chinese cuisines. If you ever have an interest in sampling some of my culinary creations, feel free to reach out to me!

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

In the internet, I also interested in aviations and electronic games. Boeing 787 is my favorite plane, while PKX is my favorite airport. I also love COMAC C919, and really wish it could reach a success. I'm a fan of JRPG, currenly playing *Honkai: Star rail* by Mihoyo, though my favorite game is *Persona 5 Royal* .
