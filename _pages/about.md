Hello! My name is Kangning Diao (刁康宁), and I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. in the esteemed group of [Prof. Yi Mao](http://i.astro.tsinghua.edu.cn/~ymao/) at Tsinghua University. My research spanning from 21 cm signal, Galactic synchrotron to weak lensing, with a particular emphasis on employing statistical methods. I am especially intrigued by high-dimensional inference techniques, gradient-based models, and validating ML-based generative models. In terms of programming, I am proficient in Python and frequently utilize packages such as `JAX` and `PyTorch`. We're currently working on the [synax](https://synax.readthedocs.io), a `JAX` based synchrotron simulation package. I suppose better sims will lead to better understandings of the Galactic structure, finally remove it to see the magnificent extra-galactic sky. We're also making progress on detecting unmodeled bias in weak lensing maps, I hope we can submit the paper before the end of Feb!

Outside of my academic pursuits, I have cultivated several hobbies. As a Tsinghua student, I prioritize physical fitness and actively participate in Taekwondo as a member of the university team. I dedicate an amount of time each week to exercising and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Additionally, I have a keen interest in playing the guitar, although I still consider myself a novice. Lastly, I thoroughly enjoy cooking, particularly Chinese cuisines. If you ever have an interest in sampling some of my culinary creations, feel free to reach out to me!

On the internet, I have a keen interest in aviation and electronic games. My favorite plane is the Boeing 787, and my favorite airport is PKX. I also admire the COMAC C919 and hope it achieves great success. As a fan of JRPGs, I'm currently playing "Honkai: Star Rail" by Mihoyo, although my all-time favorite game is "Persona 5 Royal".
