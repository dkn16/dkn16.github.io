The SKA is an inferometer where each pair of baselines measures the visibility on a single mode. The whole procedure can be devided into 3 steps: the first step is to generate the UV map distribution according to the station layout; secondly one should sample the noise ampliude on each UV mode; thirdly, one should convert the UV space observations into real space noise images using different weights. I'll introduce this steps one by one

## UV map generation

To be finished later.

## Sampling the noise magnitude

First we assume all the baselines are identical. Each time it measures, it'll get the true 21 cm visibility $$V_{\rm{21\ cm}}$$ with a noise visibility $$V_N$$ with standard deviation $$\sigma_{N}$$:

$$
\begin{equation}
  \sigma_{N} = \frac{\lambda^2T_{\rm sys}}{\epsilon \Omega A_{\rm Dish}\sqrt{2\Delta \nu t_{\rm int}N_d}},
    \label{eqn:singnoi}
\end{equation}
$$

where $$\Omega\approx \theta^2$$ is the beam area, $$\lambda$$ is the signal wavelength, $$T_{\rm sys}$$ is the system temperature of the telescope, $$\Delta \nu$$ is the frequency resolution, $$t_{\rm int}$$ is the integration time, $$A_{\rm Dish}$$ is the physical area of station and $$\epsilon$$ is an efficiency factor which follows

$$
\begin{align}
\begin{split}
\epsilon= \left \{
\begin{array}{ll}
    1,   &\nu<\nu_{\rm c}\\
   \left ( \frac{\nu_{\rm c}}{\nu}\right )^2, & \nu\ge\nu_{\rm c}.
\end{array}
\right.
\end{split}
\end{align}
$$

However, what UV map tell us is how many times is a UV mode measured, each time with a noise $$V_{N_i}$$. So you can imagine that on any UV mode $$\tilde{\mathcal{x}}$$, the outcome visibility is the sum of all $$N_{uv}$$ independent observations (this is called the natural weighting):
$$
\begin{equation}
  V_{\rm{obs}}(\tilde{\mathcal{x}}) = N_{uv}(\tilde{\mathcal{x}})\times V_{\rm{21\ cm}}(\tilde{\mathcal{x}}) + \sum_{i=1}^{N_{uv}(\tilde{\mathcal{x}})}V_{N_i}
\label{eqn:vis}
\end{equation}
$$

Our goal is to sample the noise amplitude, so here comes two way:

- we can simply sample the $$\sum_{i=1}^{N_{uv}(\tilde{\mathcal{x}})}V_{N_i}$$. It's simply a sum of $$N_{uv}$$ Gaussian variables, equivalent to sample one Gaussian variable with std: $$\sigma_N^{\rm pixel} = \sigma_{N}\sqrt{N_{uv}}$$.
In this case the sampled noise correspond to the final noise map, and no additional procedure is needed.

- Or we can transform the equation \eqref{eqn:vis} into $$V_{\rm{obs}}(\tilde{\mathcal{x}}) = N_{uv}(\tilde{\mathcal{x}})( V_{\rm{21\ cm}}(\tilde{\mathcal{x}}) + 1/N_{uv}(\tilde{\mathcal{x}})\sum_{i=1}^{N_{uv}(\tilde{\mathcal{x}})}V_{N_i})$$. In this case we need to sample a Gaussian varable with std: $$\sigma_N^{\rm pixel} = \sigma_{N}/\sqrt{N_{uv}}$$, and a weighting is required in the next step if not using the natural weighting.

Personally I prefer the second way: In this case I can write the final product of "observation step" as $$V_{\rm final}(\tilde{\mathcal{x}}) = V_{\rm{21\ cm}}(\tilde{\mathcal{x}}) + 1/N_{uv}(\tilde{\mathcal{x}})\sum_{i=1}^{N_{uv}(\tilde{\mathcal{x}})}V_{N_i}$$, and leave all the weighting stuffs in the next section, because first "averaging" is something should be automatically performed in my mind; secondly this quatity is closest to the original $$V_{\rm{21\ cm}}$$.
